	| URI ROUTING
	| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| This file lets you re-map URI requests to specific controller functions.
	|
	| Typically there is a one-to-one relationship between a URL string
	| and its corresponding controller class/method. The segments in a
	| URL normally follow this pattern:
	|
	|	example.com/class/method/id/
	|
	| In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship
	| so that a different class/function is called than the one
	| corresponding to the URL.
	|
	| Please see the user guide for complete details:
	|
	|	https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html

	| RESERVED ROUTES
	| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|
	| There are three reserved routes:
	|
	| This is not exactly a route, but allows you to automatically route
	| controller and method names that contain dashes. '-' isn't a valid
	| class or method name character, so it requires translation.
	| When you set this option to TRUE, it will replace ALL dashes in the
	| controller and method URI segments.
	|
	| Examples:	my-controller/index	-> my_controller/index
	|		my-controller/my-method	-> my_controller/my_method
